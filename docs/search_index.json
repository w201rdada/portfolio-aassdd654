More Interest, Lower House Price? The puzzles I want to solve here by behavior psychology can be quantified by the following survey question ideas: 1. How much increase or decrease of the interest rate will trigger the different investment desire from people who want to buy or sell the house? 2. Is there a satisfaction point to trigger people to make the profit by selling the house? for example, if the net profit value is over 10%, the owner is likely to sell the house for quick money. 3. Is there a stop-loss point that people will not buy the house due to high-interest cost? even when the interest rate goes higher, but it may still be within people’s patience for the investment desire. For example, the rental income can cover the HOA or interest payment, but not covering the principle of the mortgage in San Fransico, people will still buy the apartment as they believe the future increased value will eventually pay off the cost and they can at least make X% profit.

["about-li.html", "About Li", " About Li Li is studying master’s of information and data science @ UC Berkeley School of Information. She has great interests in the real estate market analysis. She believes that using data science tools can leverage the rich datasets available around urban planning, renters demographics, preferences, seasonality, economic conditions in specific markets to better guide capital decisions on acquiring property. She is looking for a better modeling which is not only taking macro business perspectives like “interest rate, land costs, development costs, fixture costs &amp; any other sales and marketing costs to appeal to tenants into account and the micro business perspectives like MLS listings for similar properties, foreclosures, closeness to retail establishments, work sites, building profiles, parking spaces, energy footprint etc, but also the developing perspectives like the urban planning, economic geography, behavior psychology.

The tax affected the markted immediately with one month, however, after one year, now the market heated up again. The policy is considered as a temporary solution or even a possible failure. With high 15% tax, why the market is still hot? It is a big question mark for the whole city. People are puzzled: who are these foreign buyers? Who else are buying properties? Who are selling properties? Where are buyers and sellers are moving from and moving to? Are there any particular trend in certain communities? Is there any co-relationship between public investment and private investment with population movements? Will people leave house market when the interest rate go higher? These are the puzzles I try to reveal in this real estate market analysis. I would like to explore the population profile of the people in the real estate market, the community changes, and the city budget planning and enterprise developments in certain area, as well as the economic factors to find out how the real estate market moves, including the supplying side and also the demanding side. My Thoughts From a daily experience, I can see several demand scenarios for buying or selling properties, for example: retired people looking for down-sized the apartment for easy management, newly wed couple looking for first home, new comer looking for first home to settling down, investor looking for profit, children’s parents looking for better school zone. All of these demands are originated from people’s social profiles change, for example, aging, marriage, immigrant status, employment status, rich or poor. Meanwhile, the city budge planning and also the enterprise investment are largely shaping the building constructions and public transportations movement. Where people work largely affects where people dine and stay in the night. The housing policy(including the social affordable housing and rental restrictions), on the other hand, will affect the supply level of the private building number. From policy side, for example, the immigrant policy, is one of the key factor of the potencial buyer pool indicator. The gathering spot of each nation, Chinese area, Korean area, Indian area, may be affeced by the immigrant policy a lot more than other area. The geographic location may also be a key factor of the market, or at least, has differentiating influence of the buyers profiles. Downtown and quiet communities, Waterview area and inland area may have different trends in the housing market. When I have the factors of deep population profile, city development, as well as geographic locations for the housing market, I can perform an throughout analysis on these factors together with the changes of the housing market for certain period and certain area. The reason I mention the period validty here, is the interest rate and mortgage policy are the key factors from my general observation from news and report from the bank. As the intesest and the mortgage policy are various in the different time period, I will also add the time factor in my analysis. From what I observe, the interest rate is impacting the housing market, however, as it is very hard to predict, to make the setup of the model more practical, I would do the history data analysis first, and make intereste rate as a custom parameter, so user can simulate the housing market status using a custom interest rate. My analysis will begin with an EDA report and follow by detail analysis for each factors. My Goal I hope the reveal of the correlationship between the housing demand with the population profile, city development plan, location, and policy change factors (or even with interest rate, economic environment) will help people to think more comprehensively towards housing market. And I hope the model I build will help the buyer or seller find a better timing for the transaction. "],
["more-interest-lower-house-price-1.html", "More Interest, Lower House Price? The Puzzle My Thoughts My Goal", " More Interest, Lower House Price? Keywords real estate, interest, house price, behavioral psychology, the housing bubble The Puzzle It’s true that the cost of borrowing becomes more expensive, the availability of capital is shrunk and the demand for investment is also affected when interest rates increase. However, over the past thirty years, increases in Canadian mortgage rates have not tended to trigger a decrease in houses prices. In fact, more often than not the reverse is true. the average five-year residential mortgage lending rate (from Statistics Canada) and compared it to the average selling price of a Canadian home (provided in a report by the Canadian Real Estate Association), on a month-by-month basis from January 1980, up to June 2010. Over this period, totaling 365 months, there were 156 instances where the five-year residential mortgage rate increased over the prior month, and in 97 of these cases, house prices increased two months later. see the chart of interest rate/avg house price between 1980 - 2010: Figure 2: rateprice The puzzles I want to solve here by behavior psychology can be quantified by the following survey question ideas: 1. How much increase or decrease of the interest rate will trigger the different investment desire from people who want to buy or sell the house? 2. Is there a satisfaction point to trigger people to make the profit by selling the house? for example, if the net profit value is over 10%, the owner is likely to sell the house for quick money. 3. Is there a stop-loss point that people will not buy the house due to high-interest cost? even when the interest rate goes higher, but it may still be within people’s patience for the investment desire. For example, the rental income can cover the HOA or interest payment, but not covering the principle of the mortgage in San Fransico, people will still buy the apartment as they believe the future increased value will eventually pay off the cost and they can at least make X% profit. My Thoughts Although the profit is the math problem, it is the satisfaction expectation of the future profit or loss to trigger people’s movement. I want to introduce the behavioral psychology in the study. One of the applications of the behavioral psychology here, 1) in general, people may become insensitive to the changes when time goes. In another word, the memory and forgetting may be one of the numerous factors of the endurance of higher house price during the interest rate change process. 2) in general, people are short-sighted. In this case, it may well present how people make the decision based on the estimate of the future. The study will help to explain why there is still irrational behavior during the housing boom with a going-up interest rate. My Goal For the housing industry heavily weighted cities like Vancouver, the increase or the decrease of the interest rate may or may not be the only key influencer of the house price. I want to use the analysis to give a high-level opinion to the local government: If the difference of (the assessment value of the house - purchased price) is accelerating to a certain level, the government shall expect how much more people will decide to sell for profit, and how much more and more people will take the credit risk to buy the apartment for future profit even though interest rate is going up based on my sampling survey data. To influence people’s decision not to jump into a heated house market, there might be some new way other than the interest rate. A rough guess on the new way: - a sad story for a bank broken person who bet on the housing boom in the media? "]
