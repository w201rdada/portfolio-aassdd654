## The Puzzle

A key tenet of economic theory is that as interest rates increase (the cost of borrowing becomes more expensive), the availability of capital expands and the demand for investment decrease. 

However, over the past thirty years, increases in Canadian mortgage rates have not tended to trigger a decrease in houses prices. In fact, more often than not, the reverse has been true. I compared the average five-year residential mortgage lending rate (from Statistics Canada) to the average selling price of a Canadian home (provided by the Canadian Real Estate Association) on a month-by-month basis from January 1980 up to June 2010.
Over this period, totaling 365 months, there were 156 instances where the five-year residential mortgage rate increased over the prior month and in 97 of these cases house prices increased two months later. 
In cities like Vancouver, the increase or decrease of the interest rate may not be the only key factor affecting housing prices. This study will help to explain why there is still irrational behavior during the housing boom with an increasing interest rate. 

see the chart of interest rate/avg house price between 1980 - 2010:

## My Thoughts

Here are some tenets of behavioral psychology that may affect how people make financial decisions: 
1) In general, people may become insensitive to the changes as time goes. In other words, memory and forgetting may be two of the numerous factors of the endurance of higher house price during the interest rate change process. 
2) In general, people are short-sighted. 
In this case, these may well represent how people make housing decisions based on their estimate of future trends. 


I want to answer the following research questions using behavioral psychology: 
1. How much increase or decrease of the interest rate will trigger a person who wants to buy or sell their house to change their mind? 
2. Is there a specific point at which people are triggered to make a profit by selling the house? For example, if the net profit value is over 10%,  the owner might be more likely to sell the house for quick money. 
3. Is there a stop-loss point at which people will not buy a house due to the high cost of interest? For example, if the rental income  from a home in San Francisco can cover the HOA or interest payment, but not the principle of the mortgage, people will still buy the apartment as they believe the future increased value will eventually pay off the cost and they can at least make X% profit. 


## My Goal

I want to use this analysis to give high-level recommendations to the local government. Government officials need to estimate how much turnover to expect in certain neighborhoods and communities across the city. With this analysis, the government can predict how many  people will decide to sell for profit and how many people will take the credit risk to buy an apartment for future profit even though interest rates are going up. 

In addition, this research may help lead to identify other ways that governments can influence people's decision not to jump into a heated house market.
