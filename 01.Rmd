## A beginning.

In the same time last year, the city of Vancouver introduced a foreign buyer tax to the real estate market, 15% of the property tax, if the buyers are not residence in the city. The tax affected the markted immediately with 1 month, however, now the market is warm again. Now the policy consider a possible failure or a temporary solution. People are puzzled: who are these foreign buyers? Who else are buying properties? Who are selling properties? Where are buyers and sellers are moving from and moving to? Are there any particular trend in certain communities? Is there any co-relationship between public investment and private investment with population movements? Will people leave house market when the interest rate go higher? These are the questions I try to answer in this analysis. I would like to explore the population profile of the people in the real estate market, the community changes, and the city budget planning and enterprise developments in certain area, as well as the economic factors to find out if any decision model exists. 

## A middle.
From a daily experience, I can see several solid demands for buying or selling property, retired people looking for down-sized the apartment for easy management, new wed couple looking for first home, new comer looking for first home to settling down, investor looking for profit, children's parents looking for better school zone. All of these demands are originated from people's social profiles change, for example, aging, marriage, immigrant status, employment status, rich or poor. 

Meanwhile, the city budge planning and also the enterprise investment are largely shaping the building constructions and public transportations movement. Where people work largely affects where people dine and stay in the night. The housing policy(including the social affordable housing and rental restrictions), on the other hand, will affect the supply level of the private building number. The immigrant policy, is the key factor of the potencial buyer pool indicator. 

The geographic location may also be a key factor of the market, or at least, has differentiating influence of the buyers profiles. Waterview area and inland area may have different decision model. 

When I have the factors of deep population profile, city development,  as well as geographic locations for the housing market, I can perform an throughout analysis on these factors together with the changes of the housing market for certain period and certain area. 

The reason I mention the period validty here, is the interest rate and mortgage policy are the key factors from my general observation from news and report from the bank. As the intesest and the mortgage policy are various in the different time period, I will also add the time factor in my analysis. 

My analysis will begin with an EDA report and follow by detail analysis for each type of the population profile if there is.

## An end.
I hope the findings of these decision models will help people to think more comprehensively towards housing market. 
And when the users are decising the buying or selling, they can find a better timing to invest wisely.
