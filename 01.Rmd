## A beginning.

The city of Vancouver introduced a foreign buyer tax to the real estate market: 15% of the property tax if the buyers are not residents of the city. The tax affected the market within one month. However, after one year, the market heated up again. The policy is considered a temporary solution or even a possible failure. With the high 15% tax, why is the real estate market still hot? It is a big question mark for the whole city. 

People are puzzled: 
who are these foreign buyers? 
Who else is buying properties? 
Who are the people selling properties? 
Where are buyers and sellers moving from and moving to? 
Are there any particular trends in certain communities? 
Is there any relationship between public investment and private investment with population movements? 
Will people leave the housing market when the interest rate goes higher? 

These are the puzzles I tried to solve in this real estate market analysis. This analysis explores the population profile of the people in the real estate market, how the communities are changing, the city budget planning and enterprise developments, as well as supply and demand side economic factors to find out how the real estate market in Vancouver is moving. 

## A middle.
From daily experience, I can see several demand scenarios for buying or selling properties, for example:
retired people looking for a down-sized apartment for easy management, 
newlywed couples looking for their first home, 
newcomers looking for their first home to settle down, 
investors looking for profit, and 
parents looking for a better school zone for their children. 

All of these demands originate from changes in people's social profiles, for example: aging, marriage, immigrant status, employment status, and whether they are rich or poor. 

Meanwhile, the city budget planning and enterprise investment are largely shaping the building construction and public transportation movements. Where people work largely affects where people dine and stay the night. The housing policy (including affordable housing and rental restrictions), on the other hand, will affect the supply level of private buildings. 

From the policy side, immigration policy is one of the key indicators of the potential buyer pool. Because certain communities contain high concentrations of people from other countries, immigration policies can bring about changes in specific neighborhoods as well as in Vancouver overall.

Geographic location is also a key factor of the market and affects demand. For instance, downtown communities, quiet communities, the Waterview area and the inland area may have different trends in the housing market. 

When I have the factors of deep population profile, city development,  as well as geographic locations for the housing market, I can perform a thorough analysis of these factors together with the changes of the housing market for certain period and certain area. 

Period validity is relevant here because the interest rate and mortgage policy are key factors of housing demand. As the interest and mortgage policies vary in different time periods, I will also incorporate the time factor in my analysis. I would create a model based on historical data and then let the user simulate the future housing market using a custom interest rate parameter, since interest rate affects the housing market but is hard to predict in advance. 

My analysis will begin with an exploratory data analysis report and follow with detailed analysis for each of the factors.

## An end.
The model will reveal the relationship between housing demand and population profile, city development plans, location, and policy change factors. This will help people think more comprehensively about the housing market.
