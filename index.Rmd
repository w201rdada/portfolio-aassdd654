## About the author

Great interests in the real estate market analysis. Li believes that using data science tools can leverage the rich datasets available around urban planning, renters demographics, preferences, seasonality, economic conditions in specific markets to better guide capital decisions on acquiring property. She is looking for a better modeling which is not only taking macro business perspectives like "interest rate, land costs, development costs, fixture costs & any other sales and marketing costs to appeal to tenants into account and the micro business perspectives like MLS listings for similar properties, foreclosures, closeness to retail establishments, work sites, building profiles, parking spaces, energy footprint etc, but also the developing perspectives like the urban planning, economic geography, behavior psychology.
